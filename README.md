# SoundCrypt: Securing Text and Images with Audio Steganography
# Overview
SoundCrypt is a project designed to explore and implement the art of steganography, which involves hiding data within non-suspicious files like images and audio. Using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, this project embeds secret information into digital media files such as images and audio without introducing noticeable changes, ensuring the hidden data remains secure and undetected.

# Objective
The primary goal of SoundCrypt is to enable covert communication and secure data transmission by embedding secret messages within the least significant bits of digital media files. The project achieves a balance between data concealment and imperceptibility, ensuring that the host media's visual or auditory quality remains unaffected.

# LSB Technique
SoundCrypt employs the LSB technique for both image and audio steganography:

Image Steganography: Binary data is embedded into the LSBs of pixel values. This method ensures minimal impact on the visual quality of the image, making the modifications imperceptible to the human eye.

Audio Steganography: Binary data is embedded into the LSBs of audio sample bytes. This ensures that the changes remain inaudible to human ears, preserving the integrity of the audio file.

Both methods focus on using the least significant bits of the carrier media to maintain undetectability and data security.

# Tools and Technologies
The project is implemented in Python and leverages the following technologies:

OpenCV: Used for image manipulation and embedding/extraction of binary data into the LSBs of image pixels.

Wave Library: Used for processing audio files and embedding/extracting binary data into/from the LSBs of audio samples.

Cryptographic Techniques: These methods ensure secure encoding and decoding of messages, adding an additional layer of protection to the hidden data.

# Encoding Process
The encoding process involves:

Converting the secret data (text or image) into binary format.

Embedding the binary data into the LSBs of pixel values (for images) or audio sample bytes (for audio).

Ensuring minimal alterations to the carrier file to maintain its original appearance or sound.

# Decoding Process
The decoding process retrieves the hidden data by:

Reading the LSBs of the carrier media (image/audio).

Extracting the embedded binary data.

Converting the binary data back to its original format, completing the extraction process.

# Key Insights and Challenges
Effectiveness: LSB steganography is highly effective in concealing data while maintaining the integrity of the carrier file.
Challenges:Balancing data capacity and detectability is crucial, as larger data volumes increase the likelihood of detection.Lossy compression formats (e.g., JPEG for images and MP3 for audio) can distort or destroy hidden data, highlighting a limitation of the LSB technique.

# Applications
SoundCrypt has various practical applications:

Secure Communication: Sending hidden messages that are difficult to detect by unauthorized parties.

Covert Data Transmission: Transmitting sensitive information without drawing attention.

Digital Watermarking: Embedding copyright or ownership information in media files to ensure intellectual property protection.

SoundCrypt is a robust solution for secure data embedding, addressing key challenges in covert communication, data integrity, and copyright protection. The project showcases the effectiveness of combining cryptographic techniques with steganography for enhanced security.
